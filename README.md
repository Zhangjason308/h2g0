A water resources app that consolitdates washroom and water fountain data in Ottawa into one app.
The app is intended as a place that anyone looking for a washroom or fountain can use, regardless
of where they are, as long as they have access to some device, whether it be a library computer
or their own phone.

This app was made in collaboration with City Studio Ottawa, and was done as a Capstone Project
as part of Carleton University's Engineering program.
